RESTRICTIONS - PLEASE CHECK THE SECTION AT THE BOTTOM OF THE README 
FOR MORE INFORMATION.

compile, sell, or distribute this software, either in source code 
form or as a compiled binary, for any non-commercial purpose, and by 
any means, subject to the paragraph immediately below.

When distributing the source code, the original license must be kept
intact. While this won't introduce any restrictions for you, someone
who receives this work may choose to use it for commercial purposes
and therefore will be bound by that section of the license.

For the avoidance of doubt, there is no requirement for attribution
on published software, only when distributing as source code.

In the below section, "this repository" shall refer to the GitHub
repository at the URL https://github.com/smileyface12349/wedding-website.

For commercial uses, the above is still permitted, subject to the 
following conditions:
- Clear attribution is given to customers.
- All potential customers, before paying for the service, are given a 
  pop-up with a link to this repository. This pop-up must explain
  what the repository is and it must state that it is possible for
  them to set up a wedding website for free on this repository.
  However, you may explain your derivative changes to entice
  customers to use your product.
