## What does this PR do, and why do we need it?
<!-- Explain the problem that this PR aims to solve, and how it solves it. Screenshots should be provided for frontend changes. -->

## Does this affect the IWeddingDetails interface?
<!-- Users who have forked this repository will need to manually add the missing data to their own implementation, so avoid changing this unless it is necessary. This includes changing the interface, or any data classes used indirectly from the interface. If you have changed the interface, you will need to update SampleWeddingDetails accordingly. -->

## Are you overriding the default behaviour, or have you added it behind a config option?
<!-- Only override the default behaviour if you're sure it's definitely better than the old one. Otherwise, support both behaviours by using an option in WebsiteConfig. -->

## Does any validation logic need adding/updating?
<!-- Any configuration that could reasonably be deemed "invalid" should be flagged as a warning or an error, with helpful instructions for why this is important and how to fix it. This helps others realise problems faster. If you're introducing new parameters or assumptions, you may need to add more validation. -->

## Any other comments?
<!-- Please specify anything interesting about your implementation, other solutions you considered etc. -->
