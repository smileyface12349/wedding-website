# What does this PR do, and why do we need it?
<!-- Explain the problem that this PR aims to solve, and how it solves it. Screenshots should be provided for frontend changes. -->

# Does this affect the IWeddingDetails interface?
<!-- Users who have forked this repository will need to manually add the missing data to their own implementation, so avoid changing this unless it is necessary -->

# Are you overriding the default behaviour, or have you added it behind a config option?
<!-- Only override the default behaviour if you're sure it's definitely better than the old one. Otherwise, support both behaviours by using an option in WebsiteConfig -->

# Any other comments?
<!-- Please specify anything interesting about your implementation, other solutions you considered etc. -->
